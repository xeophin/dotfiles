# Dotfiles

These dotfiles are a fork of the dotfiles by [Rosco Kalis](https://github.com/rkalis/dotfiles).

For more information about dotfiles, he wrote the following blogposts on his blog:
* [Dotfiles: automating macOS system configuration](https://kalis.me/dotfiles-automating-macos-system-configuration/)
* [Increasing development productivity with repository management](https://kalis.me/increasing-development-productivity-repository-management/)
* [Set up a Hyper Key with Hammerspoon on macOS](https://kalis.me/setup-hyper-key-hammerspoon-macos/)

These files have been adapted to my use case.

## Usage
1. Restore your safely backed up ssh keys to `~/.ssh/`
    1. Alternatively, generate new ssh keys, and add these to your GitHub account
2. Install Homebrew and git

  ```bash
  /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
  brew install git
  ```
3. Clone this repository

  ```
  git clone git@github.com:xeophin/dotfiles.git
  ```
4. Run the `bootstrap.sh` script
    1. Alternatively, only run the `setup.sh` scripts in specific subfolders if you don't need everything

## Customisation
I strongly encourage you to play around with the configurations, and add or remove features.
If you would like to use these dotfiles for yourself, I'd recommend changing at least the following:

#### Git
* The .gitconfig file includes my [user] config, replace these with your own user name and email

#### OSX
* At the top of the setup.sh file, my computer name is set, replace this with your own computer name

####  Packages
This folder is a collection of the programs and utilities I use frequently. These lists can easily be amended to your liking.

#### Repos
This folder is a collection of my own repos, some of which are even private. The existing lists can easily be edited or replaced by custom lists.

## Contents

### Root (/)
* bootstrap.sh - Calls all setup.sh scripts
